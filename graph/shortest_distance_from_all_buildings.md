# Shortest Distance from All Buildings

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-from-all-buildings/)


題意：

You want to build a house on an empty land which reaches all buildings in the shortest amount of distance. You can only move up, down, left and right. You are given a 2D grid of values 0, 1 or 2, where:

- Each 0 marks an empty land which you can pass by freely.
- Each 1 marks a building which you cannot pass through.
- Each 2 marks an obstacle which you cannot pass through.

For example, given three buildings at ```(0,0), (0,4), (2,2)```, and an obstacle at ```(0,2)```:
```
1 - 0 - 2 - 0 - 1
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0
```
The point ```(1,2)``` is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal. So return 7.

**Note:**
There will be at least one building. If it is not possible to build such house according to the above rules, return -1.
